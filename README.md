## Project: Automated Incident Management Integration between ServiceNow and FastAPI

_Overview:_

This project integrates ServiceNow with a FastAPI application to automate incident management. When a high-priority incident is created or updated in ServiceNow, a business rule triggers a FastAPI endpoint. The endpoint runs a Python script that:

1. Fetches work notes from ServiceNow
2. Generates a summary using OpenAI
3. Updates the incident summary in ServiceNow

_Components:_

1. ServiceNow: Incident management platform
2. FastAPI: Web framework for building APIs
3. Python: Scripting language for automation
4. OpenAI: AI platform for generating summaries
5. Docker: Containerization platform for deployment
6. AWS ECS: Cloud platform for deploying and managing containers

_Workflow:_

1. High-priority incident created or updated in ServiceNow
2. Business rule triggers FastAPI endpoint
3. FastAPI endpoint runs Python script
4. Python script fetches work notes from ServiceNow
5. Python script generates summary using OpenAI
6. Python script updates incident summary in ServiceNow
7. Docker container built and pushed to AWS ECR
8. AWS ECS deploys and manages Docker container

_Benefits:_

1. Automated incident summarization
2. Enhanced incident management efficiency
3. Improved incident resolution times
4. Integrated AI-powered summarization
5. Scalable and secure deployment using Docker and AWS ECS
